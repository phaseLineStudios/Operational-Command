	"description": "A routine lane evaluation at Wildflecken caps a week of Autumn Forge drills. Range Control wants clean radio work, safe bounds, and a pretty AAR for visiting brass. Your troop runs the lanes, pops smoke on cue, and rehearses river drills with engineers who’ve done this a hundred times. The only tension is the weather and the stopwatch—until distant artillery thumps roll in from the border. Umpires shrug it off as another unit’s live-fire. Your RTO doesn’t like the pattern; neither do you.",
