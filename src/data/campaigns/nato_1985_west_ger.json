	"description": "Under the calm cover of Autumn Forge ’83, a real war breaks loose. [b]AUTUMN TO IRON[/b] drops you into the NATO forward screen as radio checks and drill lanes at Wildflecken turn to first contact in the Fulda Gap, a DDR-led thrust crashes west, and a coup splinters Berlin. Lead a company-scale combined-arms team through delay fights, bridge denials, urban holds, night screens, and convoy escorts, then drive a razor-thin counterattack before a fragile ceasefire at the inner German border. Ammunition, fuel, and crews persist between missions; losses and choices echo forward. It’s 1983 - maps are paper, nerves are steel, and every report on the net could be the one that changes the day.",
