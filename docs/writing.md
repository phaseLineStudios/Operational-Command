## `NATO` Autumn to iron (Campaign)

#### 1. Crested cap checkride (Scenario)
A routine lane evaluation at Wildflecken caps a week of Autumn Forge drills. Range Control wants clean radio work, safe bounds, and a pretty AAR for visiting brass. Your troop runs the lanes, pops smoke on cue, and rehearses river drills with engineers who’ve done this a hundred times. The only tension is the weather and the stopwatch—until distant artillery thumps roll in from the border. Umpires shrug it off as another unit’s live-fire. Your RTO doesn’t like the pattern; neither do you.

>"It’s just an exercise—until it isn’t."

**Date/Time:** 5. Nov. 1983, 09:00 - clear, cool<br/>
**Location/Map:** [Wildflecken Training Area](https://www.usarmygermany.com/Communities/Wildflecken/Wildflecken%20Training%20Area%20installation%20map%202000.jpg) (Rhön), 3x3 km<br/>

- `1x` Fires (FIRES)
- `1x` Support (SUPPORT)

**Player Unit Pool:**
- Scout PLT, 1/A/1-11 ACR (M113 scouts)
- Tank PLT, 2/A/1-11 ACR (M60A3 TTS)
- AT/TOW Team, ITV, A Trip/1-11 ACR (M901)
- Mortar Team, M106 4.2, A Trip/1-11 ACR
- Engr PLT, 58th Engr Co, 11th ACR
- Field Trains Team, RSS, 11th ACR (ammo/fuel)

**Player attachments:**
- `1x` Engineer Squad
- `1x` TOW team
- `1x` Supply Truck
- `1x` Fuel Truck

**Friendly AI:**
- `1x` Range Control
- `1x` Bundeswehr Jäger platoon (as BLUFOR "lane walkers")

**Enemy AI:**
- `1x` Bundeswehr OPFOR Mechanized Platoon

**Scene Direction:**
- `Phase 1` **Comms & Tools** - radio check, set clock, place unit markers, draw phase lines.
- `phase 2` **Movement lanes** - Bound to Phase Line RHÖN; Trigger an "ambush lane", practice combat: report -> engage -> break contact.
- `phase 3` **River-crossing drill** - Call artillery smoke; engineers lay/clear a training bridge.

**Objectives:**
1. Complete all four training lanes.
2. Keep notional casualties under 10%; complete a CAS request (simulated).

**Failure:** Overrun time, missed lane, or comms checklist not completed

## 2. Border Probe
Pre-dawn fog hugs the hedgerows when OP Alpha goes dark. Reports of armor tracks on wet asphalt, then a clipped scream over the net. Your maps still say “training,” but the border no longer cares. Recon pushes through culverts and woodlines; the first tanks show as blacker shapes in a black morning. You’re outnumbered, not outplayed. Delay them, break their tempo, and keep MSR FOX shut. By the time the sun burns through, the world has a new date to remember.

**Date/Time:** 8 Nov 1983, 05:10 – pre-dawn fog<br/>
**Location/Map:** [Rasdorf–Geisa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9AaMDj6EZYsZKsHQ7) (OP Alpha environs, Fulda Gap), 2x2 km<br/>
**Player Slots:**
- `3x` Maneuver (INF, MECH, ARMOR)
- `1x` Fires (FIRES) (Off map via FO)
- `1x` Support (SUPPORT)

**Player Unit Pool:**
- Scout PLT, 1/A/1-11 ACR (M113 scouts)
- Tank PLT, 2/A/1-11 ACR (M60A3 TTS)
- AT/TOW Team, ITV, A Trip/1-11 ACR (M901)
- Mortar Team, M106 4.2, A Trip/1-11 ACR
- Engr PLT, 58th Engr Co, 11th ACR
- Field Trains Team, RSS, 11th ACR (ammo/fuel)
- Forward Observer Team, DIVARTY 8ID

**Friendly AI:** 
- `1x` Bundeswehr Jäger company (holds villages)
- Feldjäger roadblocks

**Enemy:** 
- Recon company (BRDM-2)
- Aufkl-Zug, AufklKp/MSR-23 (4. MSD) (BRDM-2)
- MS-Zug, 1./MSR-23 (4. MSD) (BMP-1)
- Pz-Zug, 2./PR-4 (4. MSD) (T-72M)
- GrW-Zug (120mm), MSR-24 (4. MSD) 

**Scene Direction / Tasking:**
- `T+0–10`: Artillery prep on OPs; NVA recon infiltrates hedgerows/woodlines.
- `T+10–25`: Two company-sized thrusts down two corridors (Ulster and Langenbach valleys).
- `T+25+`: Arty shifts to counterbattery/smoke. Enemy attempts envelopment via farm tracks. If BLUFOR holds both PLs by `T+35`, enemy pauses to regroup.

**Objectives:**
1. Delay the regimental vanguard for 40 min and deny highway exit MSR FOX.
2. Preserve >=70% combat power; exfiltrate 1x Bundeswehr platoon intact.

**Failure:** Enemy exits >=2 companies off west edge before T+40 or player force <50% strength.

## 3. Seal the werra
The Fulda screen buys hours; you have minutes. Two bridges over the Werra are the difference between a regroup and a rout. Sappers in mismatched camouflage prowl the banks, hunting your demo teams. Villagers watch from windows as charges are wired under gray water and gray skies. If the spans fall on time, the enemy must build under fire. If they don’t, steel will ride straight into the Hesse heartland. Pick your firing points, call your smoke, and light the switches.

**Date/Time:** 8 Nov, 12:00 – overcast, light rain<br/>

**Player Slots:**
- `2x` Maneuver (INF, MECH, ARMOR)
- `1x` Engineers (ENG)

<!-- @TODO: Continue using 11th ACR on similar units. Need more research though -->
**Player Unit Pool:**
- Mech Inf Plt, 2/B/1-8 IN (Mech), 8ID
- Weapons Plt (MG/MAW), HHC/1-8 IN (Mech), 8ID
- Combat Engr Plt (Demo), Co/12th Engr Bn, 8ID
- AT/TOW Sec, ITV, 2-68 AR (8ID) AT Sec
- Mortar Sec, M106, 1-8 IN (Mech)
- Pioniere-Zug (demo switch), 2./PiBtl 2, PzGrenBrig 5 (BW)

**Friendly AI:** 
- Pioniere det (Bundeswehr)

**Enemy:** 
- Pionier-Zug (assault crossing), PiKp/MSR-22 (4. MSD)

- Aufkl-Zug, AufklKp/4. MSD (BRDM-2)
- Ponton-Trupp, BrückenKp/4. MSD (ferry assets)

**Scene Direction / Tasking:**
- **Enemy priority:** seize intact bridges. Recon saps infiltrate; main body arrives T+20.
- **Event:** If player fails to prep charges by T+10, enemy mortar smoke blinds demo teams.
- **Optional:** Enemy pontoon attempt if both bridges destroyed (fresh crossing point appears upriver at T+35).

**Objectives:**
1. Destroy/deny all Werra crossings by `T+25`.
2. Capture 1x NVA sapper team; keep demo stores >30%.

**Failure:** Any enemy tank coy crosses intact bridge, or pontoon established and exploited.
