## Development Discussion
### Strengths and Weaknesses of Engine
So for our project we used Godot, and honestly the biggest thing we noticed right away was how accessible it is. It’s open-source and free, so nobody had to deal with licensing or setup barriers, and it felt way easier to get into than something like Unreal. The engine doesn’t feel super bloated either, and GDScript was a big plus for us—since it’s simple and readable, it didn’t take long before everyone could understand what was going on and contribute.

That said, we also ran into some clear downsides. Compared to bigger engines, Godot doesn’t have the same amount of built-in tools, so sometimes we felt like we had to do a bit more work ourselves or find workarounds. And when it comes to 3D specifically, we got the impression it’s not as optimized and is missing some features/tools you’d expect if the engine was really designed with 3D as the main focus. So it worked for us, but we definitely felt the limitations there.

### Process and Communication
When we talked about how we actually kept the project moving, SCRUM was basically our structure, with Discord and weekly meetings doing most of the heavy lifting. One thing we agreed on was that SCRUM is genuinely really useful—but we didn’t follow it in a strict textbook way. We kind of picked the parts that worked best for our team and adjusted the rest, and that ended up being a good call.

The weekly meetings helped a lot because they made it harder for people to drift or lose track of what they were supposed to be doing. It also gave us a regular time to sync up, check progress, and solve problems before they turned into bigger issues. Discord was the day-to-day communication hub, so even when we weren’t meeting, everyone stayed in the loop.

### Version Control & Project Management
Version control was actually one of the biggest “wins” in the whole development experience. We used Git with a Git Flow-style workflow, and it worked surprisingly well. A few of us mentioned that we’d never really used Git properly before, atleast beyond just pushing to main, so working with branches and a structured flow was a big learning moment. It did add a bit more work compared to just dumping everything into main, but it made things cleaner and easier to manage, and overall the project felt super organized. Tobias even said it was the best organized project he’d been part of, which kind of says a lot.

On the project management side, we did notice some issues with how we handled milestones. We created them pretty early, and later on that came back a bit because tasks weren’t always prioritized well toward the end. For pull requests, we also didn’t really use GitHub’s “request review” feature much. Instead, we handled reviews through Discord, and that honestly worked fine for our group. The GitHub bot in Discord was also really helpful, because it kept giving updates automatically, so people didn’t miss what was happening in the repo.
